           🚀 HOW TO UPLOAD YOUR CODE TO GITHUB 🚀
==================================================================

Everything is set up! The only thing missing is your permission.

Since I am an AI, I cannot enter your GitHub password for you.
You need to do this one final step manually.

👉 STEP 1:
   Double-click the file named "push_to_github.bat" in this folder.

👉 STEP 2:
   A window will appear.
   - If a browser window opens, sign in to GitHub.
   - If it asks for a "Token" in the black window, paste your GitHub Personal Access Token.

That's it! Your code will be uploaded to:
https://github.com/Rani-commits/Code-review-analytics-tool.git
